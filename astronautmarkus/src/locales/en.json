It's not easy to find something so simple, I was actually lucky to combine something common like 'Astronaut' with my name, being available even as a domain, besides I'd say it's my way of supporting space exploration, which is something I really like, and 'Markus' is a name I like, it's my name but more 'cool'."

          "answer": "I'm not really into watching series or television, but if you want me to recommend an awesome series, 'Mr. Robot', the best series I've ever seen, it's about a hacker with mental problems, it's a series that makes you think a lot, and has plot twists that drive you crazy. Do you know why I like it so much? Because unlike other media where 'hacking' is exaggerated Hollywood-level with green colors and Matrix-style animations, here they show real Linux commands, real procedures, it's similar to the realism of Breaking Bad with drugs, here it's with computer science."

For PS2 which is the only relevant console I've had, my favorite video game is SOCOM 3: U.S. Navy SEALs, my uncle gave it to me one day, I love that great game, it's so simple but so good."
        },
        "story": {
          "question": "Any event you don't like to tell?",
          "answer": "Yes, more than an event is that when I was little, one day my uncle came with roasted chicken for lunch and brought me a game for the PS2, Devil May Cry, but the 2nd one, you know the dilemma with that game, my uncle's gesture was very nice, something I will definitely do with my nephew, now I'm the uncle, the game is terrible for everyone, for me it's normal, because of course I didn't know anything about the saga, anyway it made me very happy that day, and the roasted chicken was delicious."
        },
        "os": {
          "question": "Favorite operating system?",
          "answer": "I'd say between Manjaro and Linux Mint, both are the 'chill' version of Linux, now I feel 'older' to be setting up an Arch Linux for daily work, I prefer Mint for daily use since it uses Ubuntu as base so packages are stable, and Manjaro for when I want to experiment a bit more, since it's rolling release and has more updated software."

          "answer":"As I mentioned above, I like music with high BPM, like Eurobeat or J-Pop. While coding, I usually listen to 'Toho Eurobeat', a series of albums with Eurobeat music based on the Touhou Project video game series. It's very energetic music that helps me focus and get energized; that kind of music is like a shot of serotonin for my head XD.",

          "title": "Important Events (2003-2019)",
          "content": "I remember that when I was 4 years old, my parents went into debt to buy me a computer, a Compaq Presario with 512 MB of RAM and the infamous Windows Vista. Around that time, I was also given a PlayStation 2, the only console I had until adulthood. <br /><br />Back then, I was fascinated by trains, military tanks, railways, and all kinds of heavy machinery. I had many dreams as a child: I wanted to be a train conductor, commercial pilot, soldier, drive a tank, planes, helicopters—everything I saw on TV and in books. <br /><br />When I was very little, it was trendy to buy computer games from kiosks or in cereal boxes. I remember we had lots of computer games on CDs—helicopters, planes, racing, etc. <br /><br />In 2011, for my mother's birthday, my father gave her a laptop, specifically a Samsung RV411 with 4 GB of RAM and Windows 7. That was my first contact with a modern operating system, since the Compaq Presario was very slow and outdated. I'd say that, to this day, that computer was the only thing that truly stayed with me when I needed it most. <br /><br />During this period, between 2014-2016, I was actively making Loquendo videos of GTA San Andreas under the pseudonym <strong class=\"text-rose-700 font-bold\">\"PayDayGammer334\"</strong>. I made those videos on my mother's laptop and uploaded them to YouTube. A lot happened, honestly—friends, mortal enemies, things I wouldn't wish on anyone. The good thing is that all of that is in the past and life goes on. <br /><br />In 2017, I got a gaming PC after a lot of conflict and after my computer was accidentally broken. That PC was the point of no return with technology. It has a Ryzen 3 2200G, 8 GB of RAM, and a GTX 1050 Ti. That computer is now a server in my rack, my 'personal lab for experiments and testing.' <br /><br />In 2019, I changed schools and met my most important friends, where I found my reason to keep living in this world, which is <strong class=\"text-rose-700 font-bold\">*classified*</strong>. To this day, I'm still working to achieve it, though I'd say we're still far from finished—that's the fun part, right? Also, that year I discovered Eurobeat thanks to Initial D, and became a fan of the genre. To this day, it's my favorite music genre. <br /><br />"

        "higher-education": {
          "title": "Higher Education, Early Adulthood (2022-2025)",
          "content": "In 2022, after the pandemic, I enrolled at Duoc UC in the Computer Programming Analyst program. Contrary to what everyone might think, I did terribly—I couldn't even do a 'Hello World' properly, didn't understand quotes, things like that. At that time, I met a professor who, despite his somewhat serious and strict personality, helped me with theoretical concepts I didn't understand then but now understand perfectly: Professor <strong class=\"text-rose-700 font-bold\">Julio Herrera</strong>. Hated by some, loved by others, for me, he was a great support during my studies. It's a shame he left and I never heard from him again. <br /><br />That year, I also met several people. I went from being a guy with few friends to having quite a few acquaintances. I don't feel like I'm 'close friends' with everyone, but I get along with most, and that's what matters. I met a guy who was my closest friend at university, but he fell behind, ended up failing, and we never spoke again. Maybe I was a bit 'mean,' don't you think? lol. <br /><br />In 2023, my 'canonical event' happened—my 'character development.' As I mentioned, most of the time I did pretty badly in my program, often 'sneaking' into other groups to pass. But that year, everything changed. I got my act together, studied a lot, and managed to get decent grades, though usually thanks to the group and not my own effort. This changed especially in my second semester. <br /><br />In the second semester of 2023, we took a course called 'Mobile Application Programming,' basically developing phone apps using web technologies, specifically Ionic with Angular ☠️. To this day, I hate Angular, but anyway, our team of four decided, instead of making just one app like the other teams, to go all out and try to make four apps at once, creating a front-end microservices system—without even knowing what that was XD. That's when I started taking things more seriously. At that time, ChatGPT was just starting to grow, so it wasn't as viable an option as it is for students today. The professor, colloquially nicknamed <strong class=\"font-bold text-rose-700\">\"El Harrys\"</strong>, was quite a character, literally. <br /><br />He was not a standardized teacher at all—rude, funny, no filters, would literally curse at you if he could, but at the same time, he was insanely good at programming. As a teacher, he was questionable, but as an IT professional, he was a genius. He taught us many things with some questionable examples. You could say he indirectly said <span class=\"font-semibold text-green-500\">var man = 2; var woman = 1; man \">\" woman.</span> XD. He was like Terry Davis, a misunderstood genius. <br /><br />In 2024, now independent as a developer, I was no longer riding on anyone else's effort—I could do my own projects, and the best part was, I was doing well. The problem was... now it was my turn to have others ride on my effort, and I didn't like that. I spent two and a half extra semesters with teams that, instead of helping, made the work harder, and I ended up doing everything myself. Luckily, my colleague <span class=\"font-semibold text-yellow-500\">Pablo</span> appeared as a 'playable character,' and in the last semesters, we carried everything. <br /><br />In my last semester in 2025, I got the most XD team of all—this one was horrible compared to the others. Before, at least I had Pablo's help, but here I was literally alone against the world, about to graduate. Despite everything... I survived. By the way, I passed with a 7.0, the highest grade in Chile. I'd say it's the most epic comeback ever—from someone who didn't even know how to use quotes to not the best student, but someone quite competent, literally. <br /><br />"
