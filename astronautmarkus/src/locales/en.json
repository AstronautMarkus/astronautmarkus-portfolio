          "question": "Do you work remotely?",

        "coffee": {
          "question": "How much coffee do you drink per day?",
          "answer": "At least 3-4 cups, I usually drink about 150mg of caffeine like nothing, there are days when I don't consume anything and others when I overdo it, but on average it's what I consume, an above-average amount."

          "question": "What was your first project?",
          "answer": "My first project I'm still building, it's not something computer-related, it's something that goes beyond, I prefer not to tell, but it's a life project, the reason why I wake up in the mornings, the reason to be alive, let's leave it like that, I'm working on something, but it's not ready to show to the world yet. If you come back someday, you'll be among the first to know about the existence of this project!"

        "substances": {
          "question": "Apart from coffee? Alcohol? Drugs?",
          "answer": "Nah, I don't consume any of that, I don't like alcohol or drugs, coffee is culture, it's a lifestyle, alcohol and drugs are dependency, I've always appreciated the concept of freedom, in every sense, and those things tie you to a vice, But doesn't coffee do that? well... according to studies, no...? I think it's a lesser evil."

          "question": "Why is your alias AstronautMarkus?",
          "answer": "I don't know, I think the simpler aliases are, the more memorable they are, I mean, what do you think is more memorable 'xX_MarquinhosGaming777_Xx' or 'AstronautMarkus'? It's not easy to find something so simple, I was actually lucky to combine something common like 'Astronaut' with my name, being available even as a domain, besides I'd say it's my way of supporting space exploration, which is something I really like, and 'Markus' is a name I like, it's my name but more 'cool'."
        },
        "series": {
          "question": "Favorite series?",
          "answer": "I'm not really into watching series or television, but if you want me to recommend an awesome series, 'Mr. Robot', the best series I've ever seen, it's about a hacker with mental problems, it's a series that makes you think a lot, and has plot twists that drive you crazy. Do you know why I like it so much? Because unlike other media where 'hacking' is exaggerated Hollywood-level with green colors and Matrix-style animations, here they show real Linux commands, real procedures, it's similar to the realism of Breaking Bad with drugs, here it's with computer science."
        },
        "videogame": {
          "question": "Favorite video game?",
          "answer": "Complicated, but to be a bit more friendly I'll say by console, for PC my favorite video game is Halo: Combat Evolved, I used to play it at school when I secretly brought the laptop, don't tell anyone. For PS2 which is the only relevant console I've had, my favorite video game is SOCOM 3: U.S. Navy SEALs, my uncle gave it to me one day, I love that great game, it's so simple but so good."
        },
        "story": {
          "question": "Any event you don't like to tell?",
          "answer": "Yes, more than an event is that when I was little, one day my uncle came with roasted chicken for lunch and brought me a game for the PS2, Devil May Cry, but the 2nd one, you know the dilemma with that game, my uncle's gesture was very nice, something I will definitely do with my nephew, now I'm the uncle, the game is terrible for everyone, for me it's normal, because of course I didn't know anything about the saga, anyway it made me very happy that day, and the roasted chicken was delicious."
        },
        "os": {
          "question": "Favorite operating system?",
          "answer": "I'd say between Manjaro and Linux Mint, both are the 'chill' version of Linux, now I feel 'older' to be setting up an Arch Linux for daily work, I prefer Mint for daily use since it uses Ubuntu as base so packages are stable, and Manjaro for when I want to experiment a bit more, since it's rolling release and has more updated software."
